               <p>In common words,just the surrounding is known as the Environment. Where the both living 
                  and non-living worlds are included. It is most necessary for us as we cannot survive without it and depends fully upon it.
              </p>
               <p>We depend upon it for shelter, food and even for the air to breathe. But if we are using it then we must also protect it. Biotic factors like animals, plants and even human being are the parts of environment and abiotic factors like land, air, water etc. are included. Where both of them are affecting the environment directly or indirectly.</p>
